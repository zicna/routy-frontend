## Description
Users for this application will first have two choices either to sign up and create a new account or if they already have one they can log in.
After signing in users will have their markers displayed on the left side with a map on the right. Each marker can be deleted or loaded to the map. By clicking on the specific marker (outside the delete and load buttons) map will be centered with a marker in its center.
Map event will give the user the option to click anywhere on the map which will display the form for creating a new marker. Loaded markers can be removed from the map by double clicking on them.

Displaying any form will give us the option to 'cancel' what we are doing and return to the previous state. 
Every action on this application will be followed with messages that will be displayed in the top part of the application under the application name (messages will disappear after 3 seconds). Any wrongdoing (sign up with an email that is already in use, wrong password,..) will trigger a browser alert and reset UI. 

Enyoy!
